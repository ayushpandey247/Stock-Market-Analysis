Small Cap(<5,000).

-> Thirdly, pick 10 random companies from the entire group and visualise the following
through a line chart
Find the Intrinsic Value of the company based on 3 cases of growth (g): Assume
3 Cases for g (Growth) : Good (15% Growth) ; Bad (-5% Growth); Best (25%Growth)
Visualise these 10 companies on a line chart for all 3 cases of growth going
